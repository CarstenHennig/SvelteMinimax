# Svelte code example

Very basic Svelte app for a TicTacToe aka Minimax game 

## Start project by creating Svelte app

I've created this Svelte app from scratch with npm create svelte@latest TiTaToe


## File structure

Starting with app.html we're routing to +layout.svelte and +page.svelte
In the +page.svelte we're importing 'Board' function from App.svelte with game functions

## Developing

Rund the app with terminal command
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
